<h1>These are the best movies according to Russell</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<h3>(And why they should be yours too)</h3>

<hr />

<h4>Law Abiding Citizen</h4>
<p>This is my favourite movie of all time as it tackles the injustices in the American legal system and how easy it is to exploit them. True justice doesn't necessitate legality.</p>

<h4>Avatar</h4>
<p>This is my second favourite movie, though many sci-fi films have been made, none have managed to create a world I myself would want to live in and experience.</p>

<h4>Avengers: End Game</h4>
<p>As a staunch Marvel fan, this movie was a brilliant culmination of the penultimate Marvel phase which closed out a brilliant period in their cinematic universe marked by the passing of the torch to the next generation. It had the perfect amount of action, intrigue, comedy and emotion.</p>
